# music-box-interactive-static
This Repo contains the static pages for the MusicBox front end. 
#Important notes
#1) no backend functionality (such as saving mechanisms, species, or even running models) will work on these static pages as of now. If you want to use these pages and test the backend, head to https://github.com/NCAR/music-box-interactive and start a local docker container on your computer. These pages will automatically connect to that server.
#2) some links (and buttons) may not work if you access these pages via https://ncar.github.io/music-box-interactive-static/ -- this is an issue that will be fixed once we get a permanent domain connected
#3) as of now you cannot select an example or really do anything. once again, these are just the static website files and contain no backend server to connect to. within the next few months, there will be a public server these pages will automatically connect to
#4) This repo is mostly used for testing + modifying html files UI as of now and is not designed to run any music box models as of yet
